## 🎯 Machine Learning Insights

### **🔧 Feature Engineering Recommendations**

#### **Primary Features**
```python
primary_features = [
    'Sex',           # Strongest predictor
    'Pclass',        # Clear hierarchy  
    'Age',           # After imputation
    'Fare',          # Socioeconomic proxy
    'FamilySize'     # Engineered feature
]
```

#### **Engineered Features**
```python
# Title categories
titles = {
    'Mr': 'Mr',
    'Miss': 'Miss', 
    'Mrs': 'Mrs',
    'Master': 'Master',
    'Other': ['Dr', 'Rev', 'Col', ...]
}

# Age groups  
age_groups = {
    'Child': 0-17,
    'Adult': 18-64, 
    'Senior': 65+
}

# Family categories
family_cats = {
    'Alone': 1,
    'Small': 2-4,
    'Large': 5+
}
```

### **⚖️ Modeling Considerations**

#### **Class Imbalance Handling**
- **Challenge**: 61% died vs 39% survived
- **Solutions**: SMOTE, class weights, stratified sampling
- **Metrics**: Focus on precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

#### **Recommended Models**
1. **Random Forest** - Handles interactions well
2. **Gradient Boosting** - High performance 
3. **Logistic Regression** - Interpretable baseline
4. **Ensemble Methods** - Combine multiple approaches

#### **Validation Strategy**
```python
# Stratified K-Fold cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```
